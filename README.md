# Price Publishing Application

## Overview

The Price Publishing Application is a real-time dashboard that displays live price updates for currency pairs (EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, and USD/GBP). 
It consists of a back-end service built with C# (ASP.NET Core) that generates random price updates and broadcasts them via WebSockets. 
The front-end, built with Angular, connects to the WebSocket server to receive and display these updates continuously in a responsive dashboard.
